Objective
To develop a simple, user-friendly browser-based calendar application focusing on standard work hours between 9 am and 5 pm. This application aims to assist users, primarily employees with busy schedules, in managing their time more effectively by allowing them to add and save events to a daily planner.

Development Framework and Tools
Front End: HTML, CSS, and jQuery for dynamic content.
Date Handling: Initially, Day.js is suggested for date and time manipulations, but developers have the freedom to use any other suitable JavaScript solutions.
Environment: Browser-based application.

User Interaction
Initial View: Upon opening the planner, the user should see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar.
Time Blocks: As the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks representing each hour of the standard business day (9 am â€“ 5 pm).
Time Block Status: Each time block should be color-coded to represent whether it pertains to the past, present, or future.
Event Addition: Users can click on a time block to enter an event.
Event Saving: Once the user clicks the save button corresponding to a time block, the event text should be saved to local storage.
Data Persistence: Upon refreshing the page, the saved events should persist and be displayed in the respective time blocks.

Acceptance Criteria
The application accurately displays the current day at the top upon opening.
Time blocks for standard business hours are properly presented and are interactable.
Time blocks have distinct color-coding representing past, present, and future times.
Users can easily enter events in the time blocks.
Events are properly saved in local storage upon clicking the save button and persist even after a page refresh.
Development Guidelines
Developers are advised to clone the starter code repository and create a new repository with the starter code, instead of forking the starter code repository.

Importance
This application is essential for employees with busy schedules who wish to manage their time effectively by having a visual representation of their daily plans and obligations.
